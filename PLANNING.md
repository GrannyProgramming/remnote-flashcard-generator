# RemNote Flashcard Automation System - Planning Document

## Executive Summary

This system automates the creation of spaced repetition flashcards in RemNote by leveraging LLMs to transform ML system design content into optimal learning materials. The system reads content from YAML files, processes it through an LLM for intelligent card generation, and updates RemNote via either the API or formatted text import.

## System Architecture

### Overview
```
YAML Content Files → Python Script → LLM Processing → RemNote Integration
                           ↓
                    Configuration & Templates
```

### Core Components

1. **Content Management Layer**
   - YAML files containing ML system design topics
   - Hierarchical structure matching RemNote's parent-child relationships
   - Metadata for card generation preferences

2. **Processing Engine**
   - Python script orchestrating the workflow
   - LLM integration for intelligent card generation
   - Template system for consistent formatting

3. **RemNote Integration**
   - Two approaches: API-based or text import
   - Format converter for RemNote's flashcard syntax
   - Batch processing with rate limiting

## Technical Design

### YAML Schema
```yaml
ml_system_design:
  metadata:
    subject: "ML System Design"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    card_types: ["concept", "basic", "cloze"]
    
  topics:
    - name: "Lambda Architecture"
      content: |
        Lambda architecture combines batch and real-time processing...
      subtopics:
        - name: "Batch Layer"
          content: "Processes historical data for accuracy..."
        - name: "Speed Layer"
          content: "Handles real-time data for low latency..."
      examples:
        - "Skyscanner price monitoring system"
      
    - name: "Feature Stores"
      content: |
        Centralized repository for features used in ML...
      key_concepts:
        - "Training-serving consistency"
        - "Online vs offline features"
```

### LLM Prompting Strategy

The system uses sophisticated prompts to generate cards optimized for:
- **Active recall**: Questions that trigger retrieval practice
- **Atomic concepts**: One idea per card
- **Varied formats**: Mix of card types for better engagement
- **Context preservation**: Maintains relationships between concepts

### Card Generation Rules

1. **Concept Cards** (::)
   - For fundamental definitions and key terms
   - Bidirectional by default
   - Example: `Lambda Architecture :: Architecture pattern combining batch and stream processing`

2. **Basic Cards** (>>)
   - For facts, relationships, and applications
   - Forward direction typically
   - Example: `What are the three layers of Lambda Architecture? >> Batch layer, Speed layer, Serving layer`

3. **Cloze Cards** ({{}})
   - For memorizing lists, formulas, or specific details
   - Multiple clozes per card when appropriate
   - Example: `Lambda architecture uses {{batch processing}} for accuracy and {{stream processing}} for low latency`

4. **Descriptor Cards** (;;)
   - For attributes of parent concepts
   - Nested under relevant concepts
   - Example: Under "Lambda Architecture" → `Purpose ;; Handle both historical and real-time data`

### RemNote Integration Approaches

#### Approach 1: Text Import (Recommended for simplicity)
- Generate RemNote-formatted text
- User copies and pastes into RemNote
- Supports all card types without API complexity
- No rate limiting concerns

#### Approach 2: Plugin API (For advanced automation)
- Direct integration via RemNote plugin
- Requires plugin development and deployment
- Subject to API rate limits
- More complex but fully automated

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. YAML parser and validator
2. Basic LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic API)
3. Simple card generation for core types
4. Text export functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Generation
1. Advanced prompting for better cards
2. Duplicate detection and merging
3. Hierarchical structure preservation
4. Progress tracking and reporting

### Phase 3: Full Automation
1. RemNote plugin development (optional)
2. Incremental updates (only new content)
3. Card quality scoring
4. Learning analytics integration

## Quality Assurance

### Card Quality Metrics
- **Clarity**: Clear question and answer separation
- **Atomicity**: One concept per card
- **Testability**: Objective, verifiable answers
- **Engagement**: Varied formats and difficulties

### LLM Output Validation
- Syntax checking for RemNote format
- Concept coverage verification
- Relationship preservation
- No information loss from source

## Configuration

### `config.yaml`
```yaml
llm:
  provider: "openai"  # or "anthropic"
  model: "gpt-4"
  temperature: 0.3
  max_tokens: 2000

remnote:
  integration_method: "text_import"  # or "api"
  default_folder: "ML System Design"
  
generation:
  cards_per_concept: 3-5
  include_examples: true
  difficulty_levels: ["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"]
  
output:
  format: "remnote_text"
  file_path: "./output/flashcards.txt"
  include_stats: true
```

## Error Handling

1. **YAML Parsing Errors**: Validate schema before processing
2. **LLM API Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Format Errors**: Validation before export
4. **Content Issues**: Flag problematic sections for manual review

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in YAML files
- Local processing only (no cloud storage)
- User controls all data flow

## Performance Optimization

- Batch LLM requests for efficiency
- Cache generated cards to avoid duplicates
- Incremental processing for large datasets
- Progress indicators for long operations

## System Enhancements

The current implementation includes comprehensive enhancements that ensure production-ready quality and full RemNote compatibility:

- ✅ **Full RemNote compatibility** - All card types and features supported
- ✅ **Robust validation** - 100% format compliance

3. **Collaborative editing**: Team-based content creation
4. **Learning path generation**: Ordered card sequences
5. **Performance tracking**: Integration with RemNote stats

## Success Metrics

- Time saved vs manual card creation (target: 80% reduction)

- Knowledge retention improvement (measured via RemNote stats)
- User satisfaction with generated content

## Conclusion

This system transforms the time-consuming process of flashcard creation into an efficient, automated workflow while maintaining high quality through intelligent LLM processing. The modular design allows for incremental implementation and future enhancements based on user needs.
