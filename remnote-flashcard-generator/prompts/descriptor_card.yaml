# Enhanced Descriptor Card Generation Prompt Template
# Used for creating meaningful Attribute ;; Value style flashcards

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert in creating spaced repetition flashcards for ML system design.
  Create descriptor cards that define specific attributes of concepts with clear, testable relationships.
  Focus on practical attributes that help distinguish and understand concepts.

user_prompt: |
  Create 2-3 descriptor flashcards for attributes of this ML system design concept{context_info}:

  **Parent Concept:** {topic_name}
  **Content:** {content}
  **Key Concepts:** {key_concepts}

  Rules:
  1. Descriptors describe specific attributes of the parent concept
  2. Format: attribute_name ;; description_of_attribute_in_relation_to_parent
  3. Keep attribute names lowercase and concise (purpose, components, advantages, limitations, use_cases, etc.)
  4. Descriptions should explain how the attribute relates to the parent concept
  5. Focus on practical, testable knowledge that helps understanding
  
  Common ML system attributes:
  - purpose ;; What problem does this solve?
  - components ;; What are the main parts?
  - advantages ;; What benefits does it provide?
  - limitations ;; What are the drawbacks?
  - use_cases ;; When should this be used?
  - scalability ;; How does it handle growth?
  - complexity ;; How difficult is it to implement?

  Generate 2-3 meaningful descriptors for {topic_name}:
