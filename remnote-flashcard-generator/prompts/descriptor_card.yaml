# Enhanced Descriptor Card Generation Prompt Template
# Used for creating meaningful Attribute ;; Value style flashcards

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert in creating spaced repetition flashcards for ML system design.
  Create descriptor cards that define specific attributes of concepts with clear, testable relationships.
  Focus on practical attributes that help distinguish and understand concepts.

user_prompt: |
  Create 2-3 descriptor flashcards that ask about specific attributes of this ML system design concept{context_info}:

  **Parent Concept:** {topic_name}
  **Content:** {content}
  **Key Concepts:** {key_concepts}

  Rules:
  1. Create question-answer pairs about specific attributes of {topic_name}
  2. Format: What [attribute] does [concept/component] [serve/provide/solve] for {topic_name}? ;; [concise answer]
  3. Focus on meaningful relationships between components and the parent concept
  4. Questions should test understanding of WHY components exist in the system
  5. Answers should be concise but complete (1-2 sentences max)
  
  Good descriptor question patterns:
  - What problem does [component] solve for {topic_name}?
  - What purpose does [feature] serve in {topic_name}?
  - What advantage does [characteristic] provide to {topic_name}?
  - What limitation does [aspect] create for {topic_name}?
  - What role does [element] play in {topic_name}?

  Examples of good descriptor cards:
  - What problem does immutable data storage solve for Lambda Architecture? ;; Prevents data corruption and enables reliable reprocessing of historical data
  - What purpose does the speed layer serve in Lambda Architecture? ;; Provides low-latency processing for real-time analytics while batch layer catches up
  - What advantage does horizontal scaling provide to microservices? ;; Allows independent scaling of individual services based on demand

  Generate 2-3 descriptor cards for {topic_name}:
