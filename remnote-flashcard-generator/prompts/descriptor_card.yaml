user_prompt: |
  Create {num_cards} descriptor flashcards for this ML system design concept{context_info}:  **Parent Concept:** {topic_name}
  **Content:** {content}

  **Output Format:** Use EXACTLY this format with no additional text:
  What [attribute] does [concept/component] [serve/provide/solve] for {topic_name}? ;; [concise answer]

  **Requirements:**
  - Focus on meaningful relationships between components and the parent concept
  - Questions should test understanding of WHY components exist in the system
  - Answers should be concise but complete (1-2 sentences max)
  - Use the ;; separator exactly as shown
  - No explanations or commentary

  **Good descriptor question patterns:**
  - What problem does [component] solve for {topic_name}?
  - What purpose does [feature] serve in {topic_name}?
  - What advantage does [characteristic] provide to {topic_name}?
  - What limitation does [aspect] create for {topic_name}?
  - What role does [element] play in {topic_name}?

  **Examples:**
  What problem does Round Robin solve for Load Balancing? ;; It provides a simple way to distribute requests equally across servers without complex calculations.
  
  What advantage does Health Checking provide to Load Balancing? ;; It prevents traffic from being routed to failed servers, ensuring system reliability.
  
  What limitation does sequential distribution create for Round Robin? ;; It doesn't consider actual server load or capacity differences when distributing requests.
