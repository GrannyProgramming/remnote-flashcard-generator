  topics:
    - name: "Lambda Architecture"
      content: |
        Lambda architecture is a data processing architecture designed to handle massive
        quantities of data by taking advantage of both batch and stream processing methods.
        It addresses the need for a robust, fault-tolerant, scalable system that can serve
        a wide range of workloads and use cases. The architecture consists of three layers:
        batch layer for comprehensive processing, speed layer for real-time processing,
        and serving layer for query responses. Critical for senior MLOps interviews as it
        demonstrates understanding of CAP theorem trade-offs and architectural decision-making
        for systems processing 10M+ predictions per second like Uber's platform.
      subtopics:
        - name: "Batch Layer"
          content: |
            The batch layer precomputes results using a distributed processing system
            that can handle very large quantities of data. The batch layer stores the
            master dataset and precomputes batch views. Output is typically stored
            in a read-only database, with updates completely replacing existing results.
            This layer prioritizes accuracy and completeness over latency. Modern implementations
            use Apache Spark on Kubernetes, Databricks Delta Lake, or Google Dataflow for
            petabyte-scale processing with exactly-once semantics.
        - name: "Speed Layer"
          content: |
            The speed layer processes data streams in real time without the
            requirements of fix-ups or completeness. This layer sacrifices throughput
            for reduced latency. It processes only recent data and its views are
            eventually superseded by the batch layer. Uses technologies like Apache
            Kafka with Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, or Pulsar for real-time processing.
            Critical for sub-second response times in fraud detection and recommendation systems.
        - name: "Serving Layer"
          content: |
            The serving layer responds to ad-hoc queries by returning precomputed
            views or building views from the processed data. It indexes and exposes
            the batch views so they can be queried with low latency. Technologies
            include Apache Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch, or cloud-native solutions
            like DynamoDB and Bigtable. Must handle 100K+ QPS with <10ms p95 latency.

        - "Data freshness vs consistency guarantees"

    - name: "Feature Store"
      content: |
        A feature store is a centralized repository where features are stored and
        organized for use across different machine learning models. It ensures
        consistency between training and serving environments, enabling feature
        reuse, versioning, and monitoring. Key benefits include reduced training-serving
        skew, improved feature discovery, and standardized feature engineering.
        Critical for enterprises with 100+ models where feature consistency becomes
        a major operational challenge. Modern feature stores handle point-in-time
        correctness for historical feature values and streaming feature computation.
      subtopics:
        - name: "Online Feature Store"

            Online feature stores serve features in real-time for model inference
            with low latency requirements (typically <10ms p95). They use key-value
            stores or in-memory databases optimized for fast reads. Common technologies
            include Redis Cluster, DynamoDB with DAX, Apache Cassandra, or specialized
            solutions like Tecton's managed service. Must handle millions of feature
            retrievals per second with 99.99% availability.
        - name: "Offline Feature Store"
          content: |
            Offline feature stores provide features for model training and batch
            inference. They can handle large-scale data processing and complex
            feature computations. Built on data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake,
            Databricks Delta Lake, or data lakes with Spark processing. Support
            time-travel queries for historical training data and feature backfill
            operations across petabytes of data.
        - name: "Feature Registry"
          content: |
            Feature registry acts as a metadata layer that tracks feature definitions,
            lineage, ownership, and documentation. It provides discoverability and
            governance for features across the organization. Implements schema evolution,
            data quality monitoring, and access controls. Critical for regulatory
            compliance and model governance in enterprise environments.

    - name: "Model Serving Patterns"
      content: |
        Model serving patterns describe different approaches to deploy and serve
        machine learning models in production. The choice depends on latency
        requirements, throughput needs, model complexity, and infrastructure
        constraints. Common patterns include batch prediction, online serving,
        streaming inference, and edge deployment. Senior MLOps engineers must
        understand the trade-offs between latency, throughput, cost, and complexity
        for systems serving millions of predictions per second.
      subtopics:
        - name: "Batch Prediction"
          content: |
            Batch prediction processes large volumes of data at scheduled intervals.
            Suitable for use cases where real-time predictions aren't required.
            Results are typically stored in databases or files for later retrieval.

          content: |
            Data parallelism distributes training data across multiple workers,
            each maintaining a copy of the full model. Workers compute gradients
            independently and synchronize through parameter servers or all-reduce
            operations. Most common approach for distributed training. Modern
