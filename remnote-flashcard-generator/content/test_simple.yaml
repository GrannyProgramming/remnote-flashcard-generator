      content: |
        Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
        
        Examples:
        - Round Robin: Requests distributed sequentially to each server (Server1 → Server2 → Server3 → Server1)
        - Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
        - Weighted Round Robin: Servers get requests based on capacity (2x capacity = 2x requests)
        - IP Hash: Route based on client IP hash to ensure session stickiness
        
        Context: Critical component for high availability and scalability in distributed systems

      subtopics:
        - name: "Round Robin"
          content: |
            Load balancing algorithm that distributes requests sequentially to available servers.
            
            Examples:
            - 3 servers: Request 1→Server A, Request 2→Server B, Request 3→Server C, Request 4→Server A
            - Equal distribution assuming equal server capacity
            
            Context: Simplest load balancing method

        - name: "Health Checks"
          content: |
            Monitoring mechanism to verify server availability before routing traffic.
            
            Examples:
            - HTTP health endpoint: GET /health returns 200 OK
            - TCP connection test: Attempt socket connection on service port
            - Application-level check: Database connectivity validation
            
            Context: Prevents routing to failed servers
